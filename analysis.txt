1. The wine rating varied from 3 to 9. hence, we can say that the rating index was from 0 to 10.
2. As the pH of acidic solutions is below 7. Hence for wine, we got pH of below 4.
3. to apply classifiction on pH, we converted to a scale of (0, if range is 2-3, else 1, if range is 3-4)
4. Now we have 2 scenarios.
	(a). regression on pH scale.
	(b). classification on pH_range, quality.
5. Scaling is needed here, as we don't know the unit of the columns.
 Hence we have to bring every column on same scale.


conclussion : 
1. The column "total_sulfur_dioxide" has p-value of 0.177 so we are removing it in Regression methods.
2. Decision tree is giving worse result as comapred to Linear Regression. 
3. We might be putting wrong approach with column "pH" as regressor methods give poor result.
3. SVM cannot be performed on column "quality", because it is multi-class
4. In DecisionTree Classifier, AUC decreased from 0.72 to 0.64, after tuning of the model
5. This classification approach is correct. Further, "ph_range" (accuracy = 0.93)gives out better prediction as compared to "quality"(accuracy = 0.72)
6. While calculating pH, "quality" and "total_sulfur_dioxide" doesn't play a significant roles
7. While calculating quality, pH" doesn't play a significant role
